### Our project is aimed at managing the waste in an efficient way under the Goal : **Responsible Consumption & Production** ###

* EcoConnect connects individual households to NGOs near them that provide the means of garbage
  collection(recyclable waste) through scheduling pickups from households where they have been notified of and as well as processing the garbage for recycling or reuse. This is facilitated with
  the help of Google Maps. Along with the ability to connect and donate waste, users can
  detect whether the waste they have can be recycled or not. With the help of AutoML Vision
  Edge, a ML model is used to classify images of garbage. Thus, the user becomes aware of
  what can be donated and is given a means of whom/where to donate.
